# TextToSpeech App

TextToSpeech App is a React Native application built with Expo, enabling users to convert written text into spoken audio using Google Cloud's Text-to-Speech API. Designed to operate smoothly within the Expo Dev Client, the app avoids native modules by utilizing custom JavaScript components, ensuring easy development and deployment across both Android and iOS platforms.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The app uses environment variables to securely manage sensitive information like API keys. Ensure you have a `.env` file set up with the necessary variables.

```env
GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_google_cloud_api_key
```

### Babel Configuration

Ensure your `babel.config.js` is set up to handle environment variables without introducing native dependencies.

```javascript
module.exports = function (api) {
    api.cache(true);
    return {
        presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
        plugins: [
            [
                'module:react-native-dotenv',
                {
                    moduleName: '@env',
                    path: '.env',
                    blacklist: null,
                    whitelist: null,
                    safe: false,
                    allowUndefined: true,
                },
            ],
        ],
    };
};
```
